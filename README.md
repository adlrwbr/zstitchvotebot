# Z-Stitch Vote Bot
Utilizes Selenium to vote for Z-Stitch on a google form. The man. The myth. The legend.  
  
You'll only find the rushed script on here. It has some dependencies. **You will need to download**:  
-Python 3.x  
-Selenium (https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)  
-A WebDriver (Depends on your browser.)  
  Safari: https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/  
  Firefox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases  
  Chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads  
  Edge: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/  
    
    
  After downloading and installing the dependencies, you **must** edit the script's *path_to_webdriver* variable.
